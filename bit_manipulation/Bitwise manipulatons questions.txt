1. Swap 2 numbers using bitwise operator (a=5, b=7) 
	Output a= 7, b=5

2.Reverse the numbers using bitwise operators (a= 00111011) and print the output in binary as well as decimal fromat
	Output a = 11011100

3.Do XOR operation between 2 numbers without using XOR operator (a = 1101 , b = 1001)

4.Toggle a particular bit of a 16-bit number (a = 0011110001010111) , get the position of the bit that should be toggled from the user.

5.Check if the number is a power of 2 using bitwise operations

6.Count the number of set bits in any 16-bit number that the user gives

7.Count the number of leading zeros present in a 16-bit number

8.Check whether the binary representation of any integer in a palindrome or not

9.Find whether the given number has odd parity(odd number of 1's) or even parity(even number of 1's)

10.Check whether the given number is sparse or not(get an integer from the user convert to binary 
and check for sparseness)

11.Perform bitwise multiplication between 2 positive integers without using multiplication or division operation

12.Find the next power of 2 of a given number using bitwise operations 

13.Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to a given number using bitwise operators

14.Check if two numbers have opposite signs without using comparison operators a =-5,b=10

15.Compute the absolute value of a number without using conditional statements. example a=-15, output a =15

16.Count the number of trailing and leading zeros in a given number using bitwise manipulations.
